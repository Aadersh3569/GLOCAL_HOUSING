# 🏠 GLOCAL Housing Data Visualization Project

This repository contains my submission for the **GLOCAL Civic Data Visualization** program, focused on analyzing and visualizing housing data across Canada using public datasets.

## 🎯 Objective

To explore key housing indicators in Canada such as:
- Core Housing Need (CHN)
- Shelter-to-Income Ratio (STIR)
- Suitability and affordability metrics

...and translate them into **visual insights and policy recommendations** to support better decision-making.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python (Pandas, Jupyter Notebook)** for data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Tableau** for interactive dashboards and geospatial analysis
- **Google Docs** for policy brief and research documentation

## 📁 Deliverables

## 📌 Summary

Over 40 hours were spent researching, cleaning, visualizing, and communicating key housing challenges in Canada. This included analyzing **2016 and 2021 Core Housing Need (CHN)** datasets, identifying changes in affordability and suitability, and providing actionable policy insights — all compiled in an accessible and meaningful way.
