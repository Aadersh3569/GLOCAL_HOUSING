i1,"Geography name: Canada; Geographic area type: Country; Geographic area type abbreviation: Country; Geographic level: Country; Province or territory abbreviation: ...; Dissemination Geography Unique Identifier (DGUID): 2021A000011124; Alternative geographic code: 01; Province or territory geocode: 01; Long-form total non-response rate: 4.3; Data quality flag: 20000; Data quality note: Excludes census data for one or more incompletely enumerated reserves or settlements."



Footnotes:
1,"Historical comparison of geographic areas  The boundaries and names of census geographies can change from one census to the next. In order to facilitate data comparisons between censuses, previous census data have been adjusted to reflect as closely as possible the 2021 boundaries of these areas. The methodology used for this adjustment involved spatially linking blocks of previous censuses (concordance to the 1996 Census used the 1996 enumeration areas to the 2021 boundaries). A previous census block was linked to the 2021 area within which its representative point fell. A limited number of interactive linkages were completed to further enhance the adjustment in certain areas. For some census geographies, it was not possible to reflect the 2021 boundaries. The 2021 boundaries may not be reflected as there was no previous census block to assign to the 2021 area. As well previous census data for some 2021 areas may not be available due to the fact that the concordance did not produce an accurate representation of the 2021 area."
2,"Tenure  Tenure refers to whether the household owns or rents their private dwelling. The private dwelling may be situated on rented or leased land or be part of a condominium. A household is considered to own their dwelling if some member of the household owns the dwelling even if it is not fully paid for, for example if there is a mortgage or some other claim on it. A household is considered to rent their dwelling if no member of the household owns the dwelling. A household is considered to rent that dwelling even if the dwelling is provided without cash rent or at a reduced rent, or if the dwelling is part of a cooperative.  For historical and statutory reasons, shelter occupancy on Indian reserves or settlements does not lend itself to the usual classification by standard tenure categories. Therefore, a special category, 'dwelling provided by the local government, First Nation or Indian band,' has been created for census purposes."
3,"Definition 1: Housing adequacy. Inadequate housing is reported by their residents as requiring major repairs.  Definition 2: Housing suitability. Unsuitable housing does not have enough bedrooms for the size and composition of resident households according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS).  Definition 3: Housing affordability. Unaffordable housing has shelter costs equal to or greater than 30% of total before-tax household income.  Definition 4: Core housing need. Core housing need refers to whether a private household's housing falls below at least one of the indicator thresholds for housing adequacy, affordability or suitability, and would have to spend 30% or more of its total before-tax income to pay the median rent of alternative local housing that is acceptable (attains all three housing indicator thresholds). Only private, non-farm, non-reserve and owner- or renter-households with incomes greater than zero and shelter-cost-to-income ratios less than 100% are assessed for 'core housing need.' Non-family households with at least one maintainer aged 15 to 29 attending school are considered not to be in 'core housing need' regardless of their housing circumstances. Attending school is considered a transitional phase, and low incomes earned by student households are viewed as being a temporary condition."
4,"The indicator for housing adequacy is the dwelling condition. The category 'major repairs needed' includes dwellings needing major repairs such as dwellings with defective plumbing or electrical wiring and dwellings needing structural repairs to walls, floors or ceilings.  The indicator for housing suitability refers to whether a private household is living in suitable accommodations according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS); that is, whether the dwelling has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of the household. A household is deemed to be living in suitable accommodations if its dwelling has enough bedrooms, as calculated using the NOS. Housing suitability and the National Occupancy Standard (NOS) on which it is based were developed by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through consultations with provincial housing agencies. The category 'not suitable' includes households where the required number of bedrooms based on the NOS exceeds the reported number of bedrooms in the dwelling.  The indicator of housing affordability is shelter-cost-to-income ratio, that is, the proportion of household total income that is spent on shelter costs. 'Shelter-cost-to-income ratio' refers to the proportion of average total income of household which is spent on shelter costs. The category '30% or more of household income is spent on shelter costs' includes households who spend 30% or more of their average monthly total income on shelter costs.   For more information, refer to the Census Dictionary: Dwelling condition; Housing suitability; Shelter-cost-to-income ratio; Core housing need."
